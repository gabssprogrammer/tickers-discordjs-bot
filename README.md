## Current Project: STAR ATLAS Community Bot
I'm currently working on an exclusive bot for the STAR ATLAS community. It's built using Node.js and utilizes `discord.js` for Discord interactions and `axios` for handling HTTP requests.

## How to reach me
You can contact me via email at ksgeladeira@gmail.com or find me on Discord as "gabsstaratlas" (Discord ID).

Let's connect and share knowledge on GitHub!
1. Install the required dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install discord.js
npm install axios
